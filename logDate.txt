Once there was a nation of Goths obsessed with dates. Yes dates like 12-05-1001!
One might wonder from where this typical representation of dates come from?
Well, the Mayans have first adopted the format 13/5/0001 to denote day/month/year respectively!
Later, the nation of Goths have worked upon the format & bcame up with the format like 17-9-1900!
With that ended the date game!
